My main reasons for wanting to migrate were escaping from having to write newtypes and all N instances every time I had a more than one effect in my stack, and how little boilerplate polysemy requires to write new effects.
In this1 and some upcoming blog post I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about the challenges I faced and solved2 while going about the conversion.</description></item></channel></rss>
