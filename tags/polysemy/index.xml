Logging The first effect that I converted from mtl to Polysemy was logging, originally I was using simple-log because I liked being able have areas of code run inside logging &amp;lsquo;scopes&amp;rsquo;, at the time co-log-polysemy was the only existing logging framework for polysemy and I was planning to use it, but instead I found di and decided to write a Polysemy effect for it.</description></item></channel></rss>
